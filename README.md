# Shmup-Engine-Eisvogel
Codebase for a simple shmup stage built in Unity/C#
Unity version 2021.3.5f1

Built for a code evaluation by Infinity Vector.
Basic skeleton of the codebase for a shmup game, including a test stage and a boss.
Level is intentionally short, as the focus is on the implementation of the mechanics, rather than a design test (although there's shades of that).

WASD/Arrows to move, Space bar to fire
Tested and meant for 16:9 resolution

Future improvements:
Pause option and a proper game exit
Eye-candy improvements, such as attack and death animations for enemies, border graphics, sound, etc
Moving the enemy instances to a JSON or XML file instead of the Level Builder component
More possible patterns and enemy types
Infinite levels, parallax scrolling, etc
